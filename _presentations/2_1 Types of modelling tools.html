#Types of modelling tools


Many different ways of categorising modelling tools.

E.g.:

General and specific purposes;

Model structure: internal and external assumptions;

Analytical approach (top-down vs. bottom-up);

Mathematical approach;

Geographical coverage;

Sectoral coverage;

Time horizon (short, medium, and long term); and

Data requirements.

***MISSING OBJECT*** insert manually


Draw on macroeconomic relationships and cross-sectoral dependencies.***MISSING OBJECT*** insert manually


Provide a more detailed technological representation of the system.

Resource   to  use representation.***MISSING OBJECT*** insert manually


statistical analysis of historical time-series

interrelations between various sub-sectors of the economy

economy wide general equilibrium between sectoral demands and supplies

Projections based on socio-economic, technology and demographics

Accounting + rules (for dispatch, investments,  )

Calculate energy systems attributes driven by an objective function.

Mix of two or more of the above.

#Top-down tools: Econometric


Econometric models typically look at relationships between trends and then use these for projections

Simple examples include the relationship between household income and energy use

Others might include relationships between economic growth patterns

#Top-down tools: Input/Output (IO)


IO models show interdependencies between sectors of a national economy or regional economies

They account for monetary in- and out-flows of each sector

They are based on an IO matrix of the country, representing what flows from sectors in the rows to sectors in the columns

They compute the multiplying effects in the economy of the variation of the output of one sector

#Top-down tools: CGE (Computable General Equilibrium)


Determine an equilibrium in the entire economy, and adjusts prices to get there

Outputs of the economy are produced as a function of various inputs

The inputs can be substituted for each other at various  elasticites

Consider heating   one might substitute heaters for more insulation

Allows a wide and important range of policies to be assessed from energy technology to employment

#Bottom-up tools: Accounting


Physical flows and energy balances

Examples include MAED and LEAP

Exogenously defined assumptions

Focus is on building scenarios

Have the strong advantage that they are simple and transparent

Other  bottom up  models are based on these

#Bottom-up tools: Simulation


Simulate the energy system and its operation

They can consider the decisions of individuals within the system

An advanced approach is called  agent based

Can consider the changes in behavior of consumers and producers to various stresses

As all individual components are doing  what is good for them  the whole system might not be  optimal

---
#Bottom-up tools: Optimisation


Optimisation models calculate how an energy system  should run  to get the lowest cost

They calculate what should be invested in, when and how it should be operated

Unlike simulation models they investigate the global  optimum

Can consider cost as well as other objectives

Assume perfect competition, foresight and consumer behavior being  rational

Examples include: MARKAL, TIMES, MESSAGE, OSeMOSYS
