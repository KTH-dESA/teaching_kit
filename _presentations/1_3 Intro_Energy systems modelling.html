#Why model?




Explain (very distinct from predict)

Guide data collection

Illuminate core dynamics

Suggest dynamical analogies

Discover new questions

Promote a scientific habit of mind

Bound (bracket) outcomes to plausible ranges

Illuminate core uncertainties.

Offer crisis options in near-real time



Demonstrate tradeoffs / suggest efficiencies

Challenge the robustness of prevailing theory through perturbations

Expose prevailing wisdom as incompatible with available data

Train practitioners

Discipline the policy dialogue

Educate the general public

Reveal the apparently simple (complex) to be complex (simple)

#Why model?


To summarise…





Modelling for INSIGHTS, not numbers… (nor answers)

Huntington et al. (1982)

#Modelling insights


Governments/public have qualitative ideas on the future development of the country and its energy system, for example:

Policy  goals (e.g. economic development, financial constraints, environmental constraints, energy security, rural development…)

Preferred technology options (e.g. using domestic resources, increasing RES shares…)

Future availability and prices of energy forms…

Public perception: may prefer some technologies over others



Energy systems models provide frameworks to quantitatively assess implications of different energy policy / development options on the energy supply system

#Modelling insights


They cannot predict the future

But can help understand future better and stay prepared to take informed decision

They cannot make decisions

The main task of an energy analyst is to evaluate different options and provide clear inputs for decision makers

#Modelling is not everything…


Are we really finished when we have got the insights?

#Modelling is not everything…


Are we really finished when we have got the insights?



Refine the inputs and analyses involving stakeholders

Make analysis reproducible and build a solid body of research infrastructure

Communicate the results to policy makers

Communicate the results to the civil society



Keep it always transparent, reproducible and sustainable!
