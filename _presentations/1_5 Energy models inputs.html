#Input parameters


Data collection





Data pre-processing



Model calibration













Electricity demand projections

Primary resources potentials

Existing capacity

Technology costs and characteristics

Country/region specific constraints

Fuel prices



Discretization of demand curves

Regression analyses where projections are not available

Etc…



I.e. set the starting year of the model as a past year for which actual data is available. From this starting point all that follows depends!
