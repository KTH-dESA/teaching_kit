#Learning outcomes


MJ2380-2381 2020



By the end of this course, students will be able to:



ILO 1: Describe common energy systems modelling and scenario analysis approaches and identify their key strengths and limitations;

ILO 2: Write a basic linear energy system optimization problem in GNU MathProg modelling language;

ILO 3: Apply a selected energy systems modelling tool in the analysis of stylized long-term energy planning problems;

ILO 4: Analyze various sample energy system situations and appropriately distill insights, given limited and uncertain information;

ILO 5: Include a basic representation of the links between climate, water, land use and energy into an energy system model;

ILO 6: Undertake a thorough and detailed analysis of a selected national energy system, including independent data gathering, problem definition, model choice, generation of solutions and interpretation.

#Building on MJ2413 Energy and Environment


MJ2380-2381 2020



Continuity:



Course content

Same starting point: what is an energy system

Course deliverables

For MJ2380 students: Similar structure for the final report (context, literature, data search...)

#Building on MJ2413 Energy and Environment


MJ2380-2381 2020



Moving beyond:



Course content

Deeply changing approach: from physical world to models

Diving into the analyst’s world: concepts, terminology, methodology, tools

Course deliverables

For MJ2380 students: also focus on applications in lit. review, use OSeMOSYS, larger array of scenarios, apply theory!

#Key take away messages


The energy system is a complicated network of processes and flows

Models are a useful tool to understand the energy system and formulate sound energy policies

Energy models provide insights for energy policies, not numbers

Modelling tools can be categorized into top-down and bottom-up. We will look at one type of bottom-up tools: optimization tools
