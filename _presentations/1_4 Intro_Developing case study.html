#Steps for developing a case study


Define the scope of the Study:

Identify policy issues and questions to be addressed and design the case study accordingly

Map schematically the system:

Identify natural resources, energy carriers and technologies that are used and those that may be used in the country (build a  Reference Energy System )

Define scenarios:

Identify sets of assumptions and prepare the corresponding scenarios to be analyzed

#1. Define the scope of the study


The scope of the study depends on the energy policy question that you want to address, e.g.:



What policy interventions are necessary to ensure adequate, reliable, and affordable energy supplies?

What needs to be done and what will be the costs to supply modern energy sources to remote areas?

What if environmental regulations are made more stringent?

What needs to be done to increase the share of renewable technologies?

Should electricity import be allowed?

Should the existing nuclear facilities be closed down?

Can energy conservation program help in reducing cost of energy supply?

#2. Map schematically the system


Given the scope of the study, what is it important to analyse?

What technologies could play a role under different demand projections?

Are there sub-national, national or regional dimensions which have to be taken into account?

Are there boundaries and limitations in the energy system?

One or more/all energy forms/fuels?

One part of complete energy chain?





Do not over complicate! Bigger model usually means more problems!

#2. Map schematically the system


To model the initial conditions of the system



To identify the existing competitions in the system



You may represent the energy system in an aggregated fashion. E.g.:

Aggregate transmission and distribution networks

Aggregate some facilities with common features: e.g. one technology to represent a set of existing coal-power plants

#2. Map schematically the system


Identify any possible alternatives in the supply system that could be introduced to help meet the policy objectives and targets



Identification of new technologies e.g. combined cycle power plant, e.g., concentrated solar power



Identification of new energy supply sources e.g. coal or gas  import options



Identification of "future" technologies

#2. Map schematically the system


Identify physical / technical constraints in exploitation of each energy source and technology



Identify limits for each source in terms of quantity and time of supply

#2. Map schematically the system


Based on the above, design a Reference Energy System (RES)



RES is a simplified and aggregated graphical representation of the real energy system under analysis;

RES covers not just the present configuration of the energy system, but also possible development paths;

It shows all existing and potential new energy supply chains, from primary energy resources to final demand;

The level of simplification depends on issues to be analysed and data availability;

RES should be a minimum representation of reality needed to answer the policy questions to be addressed;

#2. Map schematically the system


RES consists of:

Energy Levels

Resources, Primary, Secondary,..., Final,

(extracted  from resources, processed, converted, transmitted, distributed,  )

Energy carriers / commodities

Coal, oil, gas, wood, nuclear fuel, electricity, heat,

Technologies

Which extract, process, convert energy from one to another form or to energy service, transmit and distribute

#3. Define scenarios


Scenario - not prediction, but description of possible future development:

Consistent set of assumptions (reflecting policies and constraints)

Expert judgment/informed guesses how the future may evolve (prices, technologies )

Model results



Set of alternative scenarios:

Provide alternative development paths

Assist in understanding possible future developments of complex systems

Helps identify robust investment choices and policies

#3. Define scenarios


Specify:

Available technologies

Development of technological parameters (e.g., investment costs, unit size, construction time, efficiency, O&M costs, emission factors, limitation etc.)

Trends of resource availability & costs; import and export prices for fuel

Policy constraints (fixed investment plan, environmental regulation, other socio-economic policies)

Based on:

Literature

Concrete plans and policies

Expert judgments / informed guesses / experience from historic developments

#3. Define scenarios


Examples of scenarios based on policy constraints:



Introducing nuclear beyond 2030

Achieving given share of electricity produced from renewable technologies

Limiting air emissions

Limiting import dependency

#General recommendations


Keep focus on objectives (easy to forget)

Consider available human resources and data availability

Define system boundaries and system details accordingly

Keep model as simple as possible

Build gradually

Introduce constraints step by step

Interpret the results

Prepare recommendations

#General recommendations


High disaggregation in certain parts of the system can help in analyzing some policy options



The remaining supply system can be aggregated. E.g.:

High disaggregation at the final and useful levels in order to analyze energy conservation programs

High disaggregation at the secondary level to assess the role of different generation options

#General recommendations


When preparing your study



Review existing studies

Review socio-economic development plans

Review sectorial policy/plan documents (coal, oil, gas, and renewables  )

Review studies on resource assessments (e.g., technical potential vs. economic potential)

Review environmental regulations

Collect reliable cost estimates

#General recommendations


Prepare summary of the existing energy supply system

Prepare a base scenario

A scenario based on highly likely development path of the energy supply system   often named "Business-as-Usual"

Based on inputs from sub-sectors of energy sector e.g. power sector development plan, gas/oil sector development plan
